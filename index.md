I am a Ph.D. student in Physics at the **Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur**. My research focuses on how instabilities arise in nonlinear systems under time-periodic forcing.  I use tools such as **Floquet theory**, bifurcation analysis, and direct numerical simulation to analyze dynamical systems. I am particularly interest in research the bridges maths and physics to address questions than transcend traditional disciplinary boundary.

Outside the lab, Iâ€™m a curious reader, an avid movie enthusiast, and an occasional singer who finds joy in sketching when time allows. I believe science and creativity aren't separate pursuits, but two ways of making sense of the world.
